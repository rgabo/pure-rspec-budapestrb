Pure RSpec budapest.rb!
=======================

This a fork of Jon "L4rk" Larkowski's presentation at the RubyNation conference, April 10, 2010 represented at November 18, 2010 at the budapest.rb Ruby Meetup in Budapest, Hungary.

How cool is that? A presentation forked.

All credit is due @L4rk for showing me and others the Pure RSpec way. I'm just spreading the word.

**Because once you go Pure RSpec, you'll always have DRY spec.**

Description
-----------

Code cleaner RSpec using the latest features and patterns: let, subject,
shared examples, shoulda, and more.


Abstract
--------

Go beyond the well-worn fundamentals of RSpec.  No more will you simply set a
bunch of instance variables in before-each blocks.  We'll explore the latest
(and apparently not-super-well-known) features of RSpec.  And not just
technical syntax, but also the higher-level patterns and refactorings implied.
Topics include:  let, subject, its, expect, shared examples, shoulda matchers,
stub_chain, unstub, spork, rspactor, and havering on.
